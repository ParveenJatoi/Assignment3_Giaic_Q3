# Write a program which asks the user what their favorite animal is, and then always responds with "My favorite animal is also ___!" (the blank should be filled in with the user-inputted animal, of course).

# Here's a sample run of the program (user input is in bold italics - note the space between the prompt and the user input!):

# What's your favorite animal? cow

# My favorite animal is also cow!

# Get user input for favorite animal
favorite_animal = input("What's your favorite animal? ")

# Print the response
print(f"My favorite animal is also {favorite_animal}!")
