# Ask the user for a number and print its square (the product of the number times itself).

# Here's a sample run of the program (user input is in bold italics):

# Type a number to see its square: 4

# 4.0 squared is 16.0

# Get input from user
number = float(input("Type a number to see its square: "))

# Calculate square
square = number * number

# Print result
print(f"{number} squared is {square}")
